## About Chess and Chess Variants
Chess originated in 6th-century India, where its earliest known form was called Chaturanga. From there, it spread to Persia and the Arab world, eventually reaching Europe during the Middle Ages. Over time, it evolved into the standardized rule system recognized today, with the core mechanics of modern chess becoming firmly established by the late 15th century. As a game of deep intellectual engagement with a history spanning more than a millennium, chess has played a significant role in the development of human culture, embodying the essence of strategic planning, logical reasoning, and psychological competition.

Today, chess stands as one of the most influential abstract strategy games worldwide and is formally recognized as a competitive sport. Hundreds of international tournaments are held annually, including the World Chess Championship, the Chess Olympiad, and the FIDE Grand Prix, drawing elite players from across the globe and advancing the global reach of the game.

Beyond its competitive significance, chess holds rich symbolic meaning. It represents the warfare and hierarchical power structures of middle age—not only through the combat between pawns, knights, and other battlefield roles, but also through the political maneuvering among nobles and courtiers. During play, each move demands careful deliberation, as players must manage their forces, weigh local tactics against global strategy, and make decisions under pressure. Once the opening phase transitions into the middlegame and endgame, the dynamics of piece exchanges and positional sacrifices become a true test of skill and psychological resilience.

A chess variant refers to any game that modifies or reinterprets the core rules, pieces, or board structure of standard chess while maintaining a recognizable connection to the original framework. These variants include historically significant precursors to modern chess—such as Chaturanga and Shatranj—as well as contemporary creations continuously emerging from the global chess community.

Thanks to the creativity and dedication of chess enthusiasts and independent developers around the world, the foundational concepts of chess have been constantly extended and reimagined. Many variants introduce new piece types, asymmetrical or non-standard boards, dynamic rule systems, and even thematic overlays, breathing fresh life into this ancient game and ensuring its ongoing relevance and innovation.

该项目介绍了一款受现代战争主题启发的国际象棋变体，***现代战争棋（MWChess）***。您可以在此查阅完整的游戏规则，并了解如何通过 ***Ludii Player*** 在电子设备上游玩该变体。此外，项目还包含对其可玩性的分析，以及针对该变体的 AI Agent 开发探讨。

## 关于国际象棋和国际象棋变体

国际象棋（Chess）起源于公元6世纪的印度，其早期形式为“恰图兰卡（Chaturanga）”，随后传播至波斯、阿拉伯世界，并在中世纪时期传入欧洲。在欧洲的发展过程中，国际象棋逐步演化为如今广为人知的标准规则体系，并在15世纪末基本定型。作为一项拥有逾千年历史的智力游戏，国际象棋在人类文明史上始终扮演着重要角色，是策略性、逻辑思维与心理博弈的集大成者。

如今，国际象棋不仅是全球范围内最具影响力的抽象策略游戏之一，还被广泛认定为一项竞技体育项目。每年有数百场国际大型赛事举行，包括世界国际象棋锦标赛（World Chess Championship）、国际棋联奥林匹克（Chess Olympiad）、国际棋联大奖赛（FIDE Grand Prix）等，吸引了来自世界各地的顶尖选手参与，也持续推动着这项古老游戏的全球化发展。

国际象棋不仅在竞技层面具有深远影响，其深层抽象意涵也引人入胜。它象征着中世纪的战争与权力结构：不仅有步兵与骑士等战场角色的厮杀，也体现了贵族阶层、宫廷谋臣之间的政治较量。对弈过程中，玩家需要步步为营，调动子力，在局部战术与整体战略之间权衡决策。一旦开局布局完成，进入中盘与残局的子力交换，更是对博弈技巧与心理承受力的深度考验。

所谓“国际象棋变体”，是指在使用与标准国际象棋相似的棋盘、棋子或基础规则的前提下，进行一定幅度修改或创新的玩法。这些变体既包括在标准国际象棋定型之前广泛流行的历史版本，如“恰图兰卡”、“香巴拉棋（Shatranj）”，也涵盖当代棋类社区中不断涌现的各种原创变体。

得益于全球棋迷与开发者社区的积极探索，国际象棋的核心理念被不断延展与再诠释。许多变体引入了新的棋子类型、异构棋盘，甚至是动态规则与主题设定，使得这项古老游戏获得了持续的生命力与创新的活力。

## 完整规则

本变体-MWChess-意在 通过合理的抽象和设计 将国际象棋原本的象征意义- 中世纪战争 替换为现代战争背景。在展示现代战争概念的同时，又保留国际象棋中的经典元素，使得该变体易于学习 同时又具有足够的博弈深度。

你可以在这里找到MWChess的完整规则，[中文版](rule/MWChessRule_CN.md), [英文版](rule/MWChessRule_EN.md)。
